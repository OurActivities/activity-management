# 100 - Introduction

To register occurrences of activities, we use a NFC Reader that reads a NFC tag and triggers a n8n workflow that POSTs to an API endpoint of an instance of [iotawise](https://github.com/redpangilinan/iotawise), which counts up the occurrences and visualizes them in time. An example of an activity is to "shave" ones face. The NFC tag could be close to where ones shaves, so it can be easily read by the NFC reader and therewith cause the registration of the activity. Linked to the counted occurrences of the activity we could connect to a cost register for a "shave" to calculate the expenses of this activity over time. Equally, we could connect to an order register for a "shave" products re-ordering when reaching a certain threshold. th possibilities are unlimited.
